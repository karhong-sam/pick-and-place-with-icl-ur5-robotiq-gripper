# Robotiq

## Status

As of 2021-05-28, it would appear this repository is ***unmaintained***.

Robotiq is not maintaining the packages in this repository and the last active maintainer ([jproberge](https://github.com/jproberge)) does not appear to be active any more.

The ROS-Industrial consortia are not involved: for historical reasons, the `robotiq` repository is hosted on the `ros-industrial` Github organisation, but there is no direct link with any of the other repositories there.

Please direct support requests to [dof.robotiq.com](https://dof.robotiq.com/). The tracker here is not monitored by Robotiq employees.
